    <h3>Numbers and Sets</h3>
    <p>08/06/2020</p>
    <h4>Numbers</h4>
    <p>
      We all know what numbers are. The simplest form of numbers are the Natural Numbers. These are the
      counting numbers 1,2,3,4,5,6... and so on. You will be aware that these are not the only type of
      numbers. At this stage you will also be aware of Integers and Real Numbers (perhaps Rational Numbers
      too).
    </p>
    <h4>Sets</h4>
    <p>
      In mathematics we have sets. Sets are simply a list of distinct mathematical objects or in our case just
      unique numbers. Below is an example of a set \(A\): \[A=\set{1,4,5,6,3,7,2}\]
      Sets also come with a variety of operators that you will need to know for working with sets. The most
      common is to show that an object is part of a set or the opposite.
    </p>
    <p>
      \(\in\) shows that a number is a member of a set.<br>
      \(\notin\) shows that a number is not a member of a set.<br><br>
      Examples:<br>
      <div class="tab" >
        \(3\in A\) is true since 3 is a member of the set A. <br>
        \(8\in A\) is false since 8 is not a member of the set A.
        Therefore \(8\notin A\) is true.
      </div><br>
      \(\emptyset\) is the symbol referring to the set containing nothing at all or the <b>empty set</b>.
    </p>
    <h4>Types of Number</h4>
    <p>
      For mathematicians we declare each type of numbers its own set. Each of these sets has their own symbol.
      Here is a list of the different sets:
      <ul>
        <li>\(\mathbb{N}\): Natural Numbers</li>
        <li>\(\mathbb{W}\): Whole Numbers</li>
        <li>\(\mathbb{Z}\): Integers</li>
        <li>\(\mathbb{Q}\): Rational Numbers</li>
        <li>\(\mathbb{R}\): Real Numbers</li>
        <li>\(\mathbb{C}\): Complex Numbers</li>
        <li>\(\mathbb{H}\): Quaternions</li>
      </ul>
      Okay that last one you don't need to know anything about but I put it in there to show the endless new
      things to learn about in maths. The second last one it is likely you've never heard of so we'll dive
      into complex numbers and learn about them. First of all lets go through the first five to make sure we're
      on the same ground.
    </p>
    <h4>Natural Numbers</h4>
    <p>
      As I said at the start these are the counting numbers 1,2,3,4,5,6... all the way to infinity. Natural
      numbers come up a lot in number theory and proof but we won't use them much at all in calculus.
    </p>
    <h4>Whole Numbers</h4>
    <p>
      Simply the Natural Numbers but also including zero: 0,1,2,3,4,5...<br>
      The set of whole numbers are not used very often.
    </p>
    <h4>Integers</h4>
    <p>
      This is the set of all negative and positive whole numbers: ...-5,-4,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,4,5...
    </p>
    <h4>Rational Numbers</h4>
    <p>
      This is the set all numbers that can be expressed as \(\frac{a}{b}\) where \(a,b \in \mathbb{Z}\).
      Historically the Greeks believed that all numbers where Rational. That was until proof came about that
      numbers such as \(\sqrt{2}\) and \(\pi\) are irrational meaning they cannot be expressed as a fraction
      of any two integers.
    </p>
    <h4>Real Numbers</h4>
    <p>
      The set of all numbers on the number line. For higher mathematics this set of numbers contains all the
      numbers you would of ever needed. But about 200 years ago numbers changed because the real numbers
      couldn't answer all the questions mathematics had. Find out more in complex numbers...

    <h4>Complex Numbers</h4>
    <p>
      Complex Numbers are
