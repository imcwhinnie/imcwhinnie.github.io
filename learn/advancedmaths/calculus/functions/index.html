    <h3>Functions</h3>
    <p>08/06/2020</p>
    <p>
      What is a function? How can we visualise a function?
    </p>
    <h4>What is a function?</h4>
    <p>
      <b>A function relates one set of numbers to another set.</b> That might sound strange but lets think
      about how functions were written in Higher Mathematics.<br>
      You will be familiar with functions written as \[y=x+1\] or \[ f(x) = x+1 \] but what do \(x\)
      and \(y\) actually represent here?
      Well \(x\) and \(y\) are variables. Variables are unknown quantities that could be replaced
      by any member of a set. For example \(x\) could be replaced by the value of 5 in which case
      \(x\) would be a member of the Natural Numbers (\( x \in \mathbb{N}\)).
    </p>
    <p>
      Now our definition of a function is starting to make a bit more sense. In the top form we can 
      see that a the variable \(y\) (any member of a set of numbers) is defined in terms of another variable
      \(x\) (also any member of a set). Instead of giving a list of all the output values for all possible
      input values (which is usually impossible) we use a mathmatical rule instead. Given the input the
      function details a set of mathematical sets that allow you to compute the output. All we do is add
      one to the input.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other notation makes clear which variable is an input to our
      function. In this case \(x\) is a variable that is inputed to our function and instead of relating to
      an output variable (\(y\)) the function is instead given a name of \(f\). Now the notation \(f(x)\) 
      refers to the evalutation of our function when \(x\) is given as an input. This is the same notation
      used for trigonometric functions like \(sin(x)\) and \(cos(x)\). In calculus often these
      two notations are used interchangably and this can make certain proofs hard to follow. You will also
      most likely know of the two notations for derivatives which relate to each of the notations given
      here (more on this later). Currently we need to finish our definition of a function as it is not yet 
      complete.
    </p>
    <p>
      A key property of functions is that for an input value there must be only one value for the related
      output. This makes sense. Suppose you want your function \(g(t)\) to give the temperature for any
      time \(t\). Because function inputs have <b>unique outputs</b> it follows that your function will not have
      two temperatures for any one time. And this is helpful because multiple outputs would be problematic
      here: if you function gives you two values for a certain time then what actually is the temperature 
      at that time? Is it the first value, the second, or neither? Thankfully we won't need to answer that
      question.
    </p>
    <p>
      To finish up our understanding of functions lets just get familiar with a bit of termininology. Since
      functions relates two sets of mathematical objects then lets give a name to each of these sets. The
      set of inputs to the function (also called arguments to the function) is called the <b>domain</b>. The 
      set of output values is called the <b>range</b>.
