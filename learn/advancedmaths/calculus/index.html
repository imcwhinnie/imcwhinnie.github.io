    <h3>Calculus</h3>
    <p>07/06/2020</p>
    <p>
      A tutorial on SQA Advanced Higher Maths level calculus.

    <h4>What is calculus?</h4>
    <p>
      Calculus is the mathematics concerned with rates of change. It is a set of tools that can be used
      whenever you wish to describe how fast something changes mathematically. This lends it self to the
      real world where often it is easy to describe how quickly something changes rather than the quantity 
      itself. For instance when working with moving objects it can be very helpful to describe their speed
      rather than describing their position. Calculus gives you the tools to perform mathematics to analyse
      and describe situations like this.
      <br>
      &emsp;Calculus was developed in the late 17th century by Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz. 
      There are many resources that detail the history of calculus so I won't go into any detail myself. 
      Isn't amazing however that the concepts to be taught in a modern mathematics class for 17-18 year olds 
      are four hundred years old? Well you'll agree that Mathematicians have had a long time to improve and 
      develop the field that is Calculus. Nowadays calculus is a huge field of mathematics. I'm sure high 
      school Mathematics teachers wish their subject was as dynamic and as new as a field such as computing.
      To teach mathematics however you need to understand the topic very well and its entirely obvious to 
      anyone learning more advanced mathematics that high school maths teachers are not on the forefront of 
      mathematical discovery. But what they teach is not irrelevent. In fact what they teach, be it ancient
      ideas, are vitally important. If you think about it Mathematics deals with truth and false and truth
      doesn't get any less true with age. The concepts taught here are vitally important to understanding 
      the rest of calculus. So we can agree it would be good if you could clearly understand the concepts 
      in this tutorial. So lets get straight into the mathematics.
